# etch-a-sketch

The Etch-A-Sketch webpage will allow a user to sketch a pixelated image or colour in the grids using a chosen or default color by moving the cursor 
on the grid and holding the left mouse button to change colour. The default color on the grid before sketching or colouring is white as it will 
show that all the grids are left blank. In addition, the default number of rows and columns is 16 by 16. The maximum grid on each row and column is 
100 and 100 respectively. Any set rowsand columns higher than 100 would result in larger memory taking up the website as this may cause delays, crashing or freezing. There
are features included beyond the grid, which are colour picker, clear button, bar for adjusting the grids and eraser.
